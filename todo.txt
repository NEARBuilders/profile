# Development Experience Enhancements

## Create Development Wrapper Component
- [ ] Create DevWrapper component that:
  - Shows the Profile component as-is
  - Adds floating controls in top right corner
  - Controls should be minimal and non-intrusive (e.g. gear icon or edit button)

## Development Controls
- [ ] Create floating controls panel that can:
  - Connect wallet (using @near-wallet-selector)
  - Open modal/drawer with profile edit form
  - Save profile data to NEAR
  - Show current connection status
- [ ] Style controls to be subtle but accessible

## Profile Edit Interface
- [ ] Create modal/drawer with form fields:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Profile Image URL/IPFS
  - Background Image URL/IPFS
  - Social Links (GitHub, Twitter, Telegram, LinkedIn, Website)
- [ ] Live preview of changes in the Profile component below

## Build Configuration
- [ ] Ensure development dependencies (@near-wallet-selector, near-api-js) are not included in production bundle
- [ ] Configure build to exclude DevWrapper and controls in production
- [ ] Verify Profile module export only includes necessary components/dependencies

## Bootstrap Modification
- [ ] Modify bootstrap.tsx to:
  - In development: Wrap Profile with DevWrapper
  - In production: Render Profile directly
- [ ] Keep Profile component pure and independent of development tools

## Testing
- [ ] Test development mode functionality
- [ ] Verify production bundle size and dependencies
- [ ] Ensure Profile module works standalone in production
